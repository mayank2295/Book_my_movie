#  Movie Ticket Booking System (CMD Based ‚Äì Java + JDBC + MySQL)

A **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** based Java project that simulates a simplified version of **BookMyShow**. This system allows users to browse movies, select showtimes, view available seats, and book tickets. It is built using **Java**, **JDBC**, and **MySQL**, showcasing core backend and database handling skills.

##  Technologies Used

- **Java** (Object-Oriented Programming, CLI Interaction)
- **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity)
- **MySQL** (Relational Database)

##  How to Run

1. Make sure MySQL is installed and running on your system  
2. Update your database credentials in the JDBC config file (inside the `config` package)  
3. Import the project into an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse  
4. Run the main class from the `service` package  
5. Follow the CLI prompts to:
   - Browse movies and shows  
   - Choose a seat  
   - Book your ticket
